                they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.</h3>

                The first one has a second parameter e, which refers to each element. This will make each list item's text color
                turn yellow. The second two use 'this' to refer to the list element, which will cause the same effect to be applied:
                each list item will have its color turned yellow. Overall, the three functions will result in the same visual effect.
