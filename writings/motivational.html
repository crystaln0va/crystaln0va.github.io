            <h1 class="title">Motivational Poison</h1>

            <p>Why are motivational speeches and ideas in our culture so exclusive and toxic?</p>
            <p>Look up "Motivational Speech" on YouTube.</p>
            <p><i>"90% of people are lazy"</i>
                <br><i>"To be great, leave the losers in the dust and set yourself apart from them"</i>
            </p>
            <p>This seems to be the tone.</p>
            <p>How many advertisements, inspirational movies, and career pathways echo this undertone?</p>
            <p>This attempt at positivity is, at best, short-sighted and very egotistical. It invites us to 
                build ourselves up by putting other people down, or at least below us in our minds. Is this 
                true strength? While many people may have gotten far in their pursuits with this pseudo-
                strong mindset, a major drawback is that people frequently misuse this as license to look 
                down on others, which tends to be more divisive than unifying in a community. It pollutes, 
                intoxicates, and degrades our minds that should be searching for the beauty and potential 
                in everyone.</p>
            <p>Because this "winner's mentality" is such a default in our unnaturally competitive culture, 
                many well-intending people may not even realize that there are alternative philosophies that 
                lead to an even deeper, more tender excellence. We may have been thinking in these competitive 
                patterns for so long that we don't even notice. In a world as harsh as this one, we thrust 
                ourselves into the quest for a strong mind as we fight the adversities in our lives. Often the 
                nearest one to grab is this "winner's mentality", which naturally implies the presence of a 
                loser, as well as our superiority to them (toxicity).</p>
            <p>Isn't the goal of building ourselves up supposed to be to lift others up with us, not to 
                distance and elevate ourselves over them? Why does one's self-worth have to have any 
                comparison-based element built into it at all?</p>
            <p>I'm strong because I outlasted everyone else, vs.
                <br>I'm strong because I fought with my heart.</p>
            <p>Go the distance that others aren't willing to go, vs.
                <br>Go farther than you did yesterday.</p>
            <p>Is there a form of encouragement that can become the social norm that doesn't rely on putting 
                "them" down? Perhaps one that focuses on the joy of discovery, inclusion, and love itself?</p>
