        <h3>1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?</h3>
        <p>setTimeout(booyah, 2000);<br>
        setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);</p>
        <p class="response">
            We need <em>booyah</em> to be a callback function, or a function who does not execute until a specific desired time.
            In this case it would be after 2000 milliseconds, or 2 seconds. If we place the parentheses after <em>booyah</em>
            as <em>booyah()</em>, the function will be called <em>immediately</em>, and this will defeat the purpose
            of setting the timer.
        </p>


        <h3>2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?</h3>
        <p>var myfunc = function(a, x) {<br>
            return a * x;<br>
           };<br>
           var x = myfunc(2, 3);<br>
           var y = myfunc;<br>
           alert(x);<br>
           alert(y(2,3));</p>
           <p class="response">
               In the first case, this alert will simply display the result of calling the function <em>myfunc</em>.
                Two arguments are provided, and they will pass through the parameters <em>a</em> and <em>x</em>,
                respectively. They will be multiplied together, and the outcome will be <b style="font-size: 1.5em;">6</b>.<br><br>
                In the second case, <em>y</em> stores the function <em>myfunc</em>. When the function is called,
                two arguments are passed, <em>2</em> and <em>3</em>, respectively. Ultimately, this is only the same
                action as before, and the arguments will be accepted and multiplied together. Thus, the outcome in this
                case is also <b style="font-size: 1.5em;">6</b>.
            </p>


        <h3>3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
            says “BOOYAH!”</h3>
            <p>setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);<br>
                setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);</p>
                <p class="response">
                    function booyah1() = {<br>
                        &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 alert("BOOYAH!");<br>
                    }<br>
                    function booyah2() = {<br>
                        &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 return function() {<br>
                            &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 alert("BOOYAH!");<br>
                            &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 }; <br>
                    }<br>
                </p>


        <h3>4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
            for using it)?</h3>
            <p class="response">Unobtrusive JavaScript is the organization of JavaScript code into a separate script file.
                It is used to keep code clean, organized, accessible, and simple. It puts all of the JavaScript into
                one place, so that modifications are easy to implement, and the location of elements is easy and clear.
